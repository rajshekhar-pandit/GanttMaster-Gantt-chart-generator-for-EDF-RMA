# GanttMaster - Gantt Chart Generator for EDF and RMA

GanttMaster is a tool for generating Gantt charts to visualize **EDF (Earliest Deadline First)** and **RMA (Rate Monotonic Algorithm)** scheduling for real-time systems.  
It helps demonstrate how these scheduling algorithms work by turning process schedules into clear and helpful Gantt charts.

## ðŸ”¹FeaturesðŸ”¹

- **Generates Gantt charts** for both **EDF** and **RMA** schedules.
- **Displays process IDs, periods, and deadlines** alongside their schedules.
- **Provides a clear visualization** for understanding algorithm behavior.
- **Helps identify** deadline misses or scheduling issues.

## ðŸ”¹TechnologiesðŸ”¹

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- React (with functional components)
- D3 or canvas for Gantt chart rendering
- Node.js (optional) for future API expansion

## ðŸ”¹InstallationðŸ”¹

1. **Clone this repository:**

  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajshekhar-pandit/GanttMaster-Gantt-chart-generator-for-EDF-RMA.git

```
### Change Directory
 ```bash
cd GanttMaster-Gantt-chart-generator-for-EDF-RMA
```
